# virtual-assistant-Desktop- For Windows

The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for windowsbased systemsJarvis draws its inspiration from virtual assistants
like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed
to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of
tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can
interact with the assistant either through voice commands or
using keyboard input. As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the
end-user with day-to-day activities like general human
conversation, searching queries in google, bing or yahoo,
searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions,
word meanings, searching for medicine details, reminding the
user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user
statements/commands are analysed with the help of machine
learning to give an optimal solution. Keywords:- Personal
Assistant, , Automation, Machine Learning.

1. Queries from the web:
Making queries is an essential
part of one’s life, and nothing changes even for a
developer working on Linux. We have addressed the
essential part of a netizen’s life by enabling our voice
assistant to search the web. Here we have used Node
JS and Selenium framework for extracting the result from
the web as well as displaying it to the user. Jarvis
supports a plethora of search engines like Google, Bing
and Yahoo and displays the result by scraping the
searched queries. In order to make queries from different
search engines, the given format should be adopted:
2. Accessing youtube videos :
Videos have remained
as a main source of entertainment, one of the most
prioritized tasks of virtual assistants. They are equally
important for entertainment as well as educational
purposes as most teaching and research activities in
present times are done through Youtube. This helps in
making the learning process more practical and out of
the four walls of the classroom. Jarvis implements the
feature through a subprocess module which is handled
by the main Golang service. This service initiates the
subprocess for Node JS which serves the Selenium
WebDriver, and scraps the searched YouTube query.
3. Get weather for a location:
Getting live weather
conditions about a place remains an important task of
virtual assistants. It helps the user charter the course
of their action. Jarvis addresses this issue with the
help of Python.
4. Set Reminders :
One of the main features of a voice
assistant is to set a reminder for the user accordingly.
Jarvis is no different when it comes to this. The user can
set reminders to be notified about a task at a particular
time. This will help users, especially developers to
schedule their time and resources easily. All the user
have to do is to input Set reminder to the assistant. A
form will be displayed. Fill the form with the required
details and click on set reminder button.
5. Sending Emails :
Integrating mailing features to
Jarvis eases the job of mailing, which otherwise would
have to be done by opening the concerned email
address. With Jarvis, you do not need to go for another
tab to do one of the major task of your day to day
affairs. The user can send emails to the desired
receiver. He should input Send mail, after which a form
will be displayed. Fill the form with the required details
and click on the send mail button.
And it can also perform many functions like Corona update, Bank Information,Air Quality of any city,Sunrise & Sunset Timing of any city and Many more.
